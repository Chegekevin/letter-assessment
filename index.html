    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,

        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        of
        your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>

        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

        You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com."> important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
        fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
        and just
        the
        kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
        intrigued by
        are
        as follows, in order of priority:

       <ul> 1.Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</ul>
       <ul>2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
        audience</ul>
        <ul>3.size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</ul>
        HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.

        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
        the
        research
        to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question,
        my
        favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
        involved
        huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very
        rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles
        such as
        Twerking.</p>
    <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
        involved
        huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very
        rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles
        such as
        Twerking.</p>

        Yours sincerely,</br>
